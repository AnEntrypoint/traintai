"""Generate persona-anchored synthetic NPC conversations from character cards.

The demo failure mode was the model inventing names and drifting off-question.
These synthetic conversations are correct by construction: every answer names
the character from its card, references its scenario, and answers the actual
question intent (greeting / identity / sale / quest / place / lore / farewell).

Sources: NousResearch/CharacterCodex cards, amaydle bios, chimbiwide char_bio.
Output: data/npc/synthetic.jsonl in the same render format as npc_prepare.py
consumed (### System / ### Player / ### NPC turns).
