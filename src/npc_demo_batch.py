"""Demo: 10 NPC conversations generated as one batched GPU pass.

Ten personas with ten player questions run through the batched CUDA-graph
engine (src/gpu_batch_infer.py) against the ship checkpoint, sampled, then
cut at the turn markers. Prompts are SillyTavern format -- card fields plus
name-prefixed turns -- matching what the model is trained for.
